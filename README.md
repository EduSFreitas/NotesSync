Notes Sync is the answer to your everyday note taking requirements. It was designed with the primary goal of being privacy oriented and convenient. Taking notes, creating to-do lists, setting reminders, adding images and sharing with others, everything is just one tap away. And, it's all instantly searchable.

With Notes Sync you can sync all of your notes, to-do lists and reminders to your <b>own Google Drive or Dropbox accounts.</b> So, everything is synced across your devices and backed up to the cloud. But the best part is, everything goes directly from the app to your account. Also your data can be encrypted with <b>AES 256-bit encryption.</b> And nothing goes through our servers. This ensures <b>Total Privacy.</b>

Other features include themes, colored notes and app lock.
